= Just enough Elixir

This chapter is focused on learning the minimal amount of Elixir required to understand the code in a Phoenix project. We will quickly run through various basic Elixir concepts using the Phoenix project created in Chapter 1 to validate our learning. If you are already familiar with Elixir, you might want to skip this chapter or just scan through it quickly.
