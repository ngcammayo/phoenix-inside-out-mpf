== Summary

We learned how to organize our code in modules by Context. 

We explored the importance of conn, saw how it gets passed across the entire project, and learnt how to pass variables to our templates.

We created a few acceptance tests for the various modules we have so far. We also saw the use of the `DataCase` to set up the database for our tests.

Finally, we started with a hardcoded list of products and transitioned to using Ecto with a database. Through this process we were able to see the difference between a database table and a schema. We further stretched our knowledge of working with data by setting up seed data, importing data from a CSV file with Nimble, and by using the reset command to drop and recreate the database.
