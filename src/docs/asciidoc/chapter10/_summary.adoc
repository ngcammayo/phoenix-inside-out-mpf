== Summary
In this chapter, we explored an undocumented feature of the Phoenix framework that allows us to customize the files generated by the Mix task `phx.gen.html`. We did very minimal customizations on the `index` and `edit` pages of our generated resources. However, this gives us enough knowledge to make further customizations should we need to change any of the files generated by `phx.gen.html`.

We then looked into the concept of multiple sources of fragmented truth which becomes a norm when using Phoenix Context.
